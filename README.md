#Integrated-Crop-Management

An integrated expert decision support system for crop management, indicated that a major weakness of the expert system format was in formulating a schedule of guidelines for management actions.

Problems encountered included organizing and integrating knowledge bases for several different types of action (e.g. pest management, irrigation, fertilization, etc.), dealing with the influence that these actions have on each other, and the automated synthesis of the actual guidelines.

To solve these problems a scheduling system was developed for the Farmers based on the concept of the multi-agent planner as developed in artificial intelligence research.
